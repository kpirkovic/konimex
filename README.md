# Konimex - Website Design & Development  
Konimex Holding is Macedonia‚Äôs leading manufacturer of essential oils and organic products, as well as a processor and maker of pharmaceutical products, aromatic herbs, teas, spices, and vinegar.

The company has been in operation for over 22 years and exports to 28 countries. As a part of my web design Bootcamp at SEDC, I was assigned this project.

We were tasked with creating a website for Konimex so they could establish their online presence.As the project's team leader, it was my responsibility to assign tasks to my team, assist them with design and development, and ensure that we completed the assignments on time.

We initially started this project as a raw Bootstrap WordPress theme but the client requested that we should build this project with WordPress page builder Elementor so that he may make minor adjustments in the future without having to employ a developer.

We exceeded the client's expectations, and he was extremely happy with the final results.
